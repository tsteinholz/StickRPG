## History
This game was originally build from 2003-2005 by XGenStudios. They built their
game on the adobe flash platform for browsers. I used to play stick RPG
all the time, I remember having all the coolest things, being super rich, strong
successful. It was just an amazing time and I wanted to recreate that fun while
learning javascript / coffeescript as well as html5 and all this other cool stuff.
